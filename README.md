# How do I approach designing software?
Some design skills that I have gained while developing this project is how you can use primitive shapes to create more complex shapes. For instance, I learned that triangles make up the bulk of how you draw objects behind the scenes.
The design process that I used behind scenes was breaking down what each object needed and how I would approach it. For instance, I looked at the lotion bottle and I realized that it actually was made using simple shapes that I already knew how to make. 
The tactics that I used in my design approach could be used in future work by knowing how to break down objects. I also know how to approach breaking up code to make it more reusable and encapsulating code into other files can help simplify things.

# How do I approach developing programs.
Some new development strategies that I used while working on my 3D scene were breaking up the code into methods and classes that allowed for reuse. 
Iteration factored into my development as my code went through several cycles when I discovered easier ways to do things. My code began as simple shapes and as I learned about more shapes and more features of OpenGL my code got more complex and I had to hide that in different methods. 
My approach to developing code evolved as I learned more about how C++ and OpenGL handle the code and how I could utilize the libraries to my advantage. 

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The knowledge that I have gained in computer graphics has given me the skillset to be able to understand how computers print and model things on the computer. For instance, I understand how triangles are an important part of the process. This allows me to educate myself further when I would need to model something in the future. It would also allow me to pursue a professional path forward as I could study and do more with graphics design if I were to pursue that.
